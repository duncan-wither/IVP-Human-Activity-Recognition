# Multi-modal Human Activity Recognition
Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using the [Multi-Modal Data-set](https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/mex-multi-modal-exercise-dataset)

Looks at comparing the results between a deep learning method (MC-DNN?) and kNN with DTW, as part of an assignment for 
the EE581 - Image and Video Processing Class at Strathclyde University.
