# Multi-Modal Neural Network
This module originally aimed to replicate the functionality shown in 
[this paper](http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-319-08010-9_33) by Zheng et. al. and implement it on the MEx dataset. 
It was found in the course of the work however that using multilayer perceptron's worked significantly better for the accelerometer data than the CNNs suggested.
This is the model used here.

## Datasets
This contains the functionality to extract the data from the MEx dataset.
Each module contains the same basic list of functions:
 - `Datasets Function 1` 

## Models
This contains the architecture of the MM-NN.
 - `Models Function 1`
