# MEX Utilities
This is just a small module to provide some utilities specific to the MEx dataset.

The two functions are:
 - `create_mex_str` provides a quick way to create a sting with the file location of the csv file for processing.
 - `down_sample` mainly to reduce information coming from the accelerometers.
