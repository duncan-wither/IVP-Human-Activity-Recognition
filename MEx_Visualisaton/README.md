# MEx Data Visualisation 
Within the `gif/` folder contains an example gif of the animated accelerometer data. This is created from a sequences of static images generated by the `Accel_Animation.py` script ,which are then combined using ImageMagick. The cluster size and number of frames can be changed by adjusting the script.

An example command to generate the animation would be:
`convert -delay 50 *.png accel_animated.gif`

This is very memory intensive and can crash the computer is too many/too large images are used.
## Scripts
 - `Accel_Animation.py1` creates a series of images based on clusters of accelerometer data.
 - `Visual_DC.py` takes the output of the depth camera and makes a time lapse video.
 - `Visual_PM.py` data from the pressure mat is normalised and treated as an image, as for the depth camera the frames are put together in a time lapse video.
 - `Visual_Acc.py` prints on a 3D graph the data from the two accelerometers, based on the user input.
